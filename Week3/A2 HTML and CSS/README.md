Objectives
Create a static website using HTML & CSS for a finance company

Deadline: 1st January 2022 (7 pm PKT)

Task 1: Create a clone of this project
Follow this link: https://banky.webflow.io/ and create a clone of this project.

For stock and vector images, use this website: www.freepik.com

There are certain elements that require javascript and I do not expect you to know all this but I do expect you to try and learn to get this done.

This task is quite difficult but try to build this to the best of your abilities. If you complete this project and produce high-quality work, we will use this as one of your projects and will help you get a gig on Fiver!

Good luck!
